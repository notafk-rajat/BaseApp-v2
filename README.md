# BaseApp-v2

This is version 2 of the base application with improved metrics. In this version, we went through some code modifications with a specific focus on JS Minification. This did improve the overall metrics of the application but took a little toll on the readability of the code. However, this can be easily improved upon with a properly planned structured code. The goal for upcoming versions would be to improve the structure of the code along with adopting more optimization techniques to improve the metrics further.

Here are the improved metrics
