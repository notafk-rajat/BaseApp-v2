# BaseApp-v2

This is the version 2 of the base application with improved metrics. In this version we went through some code modificaitons and with a specific focus on JS Minification. This
did improved the the overall metrics of the application but however took a little toll on readabiility of the code. However this can be easily improved upon with a 
properly planned structurised code.
Goal for upcoming versions would be to improve the structure of the code along with adopting more optimization techniques to improve the metrics further.

Here are the improved metrics
